                <h3>Super Smash Bros. is a Nintendo game series that is a fighting game that consists of many characters from a variety of Nintendo based games. As opposed to depleting your opponent’s health until they lose like in most fighting games, Super Smash Bros. aims to make players knock each other off of a flat platform or stage. In 1999, Masahiro Sakurai released the first edition of a game that he never expected would be so successful. HAL Laboratory was a first party developer for the widely known company Nintendo. During the 1990's, fighting style games were the trend spanning from arcades to consoles to different variations. The biggest fighting style game at the time was Mortal Kombat. The nineties were also a major testing ground for video games in general because the sheer amount and popularity of virtual entertainment was increasing exponentially. Nintendo was known for several hits by this time such as Donkey Kong and Super Mario Bros. so the pressure was on Masahiro Sakurai to make a phenomenal game. Sakurai's first renders of the game did not have any Nintendo characters and also had a very different name. In 1998, Sakurai and Satoru Iwata were working on the first edition of Super Smash Bros. called Dragon King: The Fighting Game which had no Nintendo characters. The idea to add Nintendo characters came to him when he felt like he needed to give the game a more home console atmosphere as opposed to an arcade atmosphere, so using household names such as Mario, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Fox, and so on just seemed logical to Sakurai. Originally, the game had an extremely small budget and was barely advertised and was only intended to be a Japan only release due to its small scale. To everyone’s surprise, the first game sold over a million copies in Japan alone upon its release, so it then moved to be released to the rest of the world. This increased its budget and promotion for the future allowing the succeeding games to be even more successful and better. The competitive Esports scene was not something that eluded Super Smash Bros.. The mechanics, objective, and variation in the game all contributed to creating a very competitive atmosphere due to how unique every player can be in the same fair playing ground. Although Nintendo never organized their own competitive tournaments and even banned Major League Gaming from organizing SSB tournaments, the gaming community never ceased to organize their own large-scale events with major prizes and stream these major events over Twitch. The Super Smash Bros. community is so strong that they did not really need an official company or marketing team to put together tournaments housing thousands. One of these large-scale groups that organized tournaments was the New Jersey based Apex. Apex eventually went on to be sponsored by Nintendo in 2015.</h3>
