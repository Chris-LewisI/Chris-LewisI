                <h3>In June of 2013, I was in an advanced summer program held at New Jersey City University called Proyecto. Before then, I had no idea what programming was, what it took to create a website, application, video game, or anything really for that matter. I was just an eighth-grader trying to get out of class to go and play ball or video games. One of the classes offered in this program was a course HTML, and after attending many courses, I began to develop an interest. I always had a knack for technology and creation when I was younger, so when I was able to see that text on my website would appear as I use a “< p >” tag in a text editor, it struck me instantly. After that, I took Java fundamentals in Bayonne High School and loved that course. Most inspirations in my life stemmed from technology-themed things such as the film <em>Chappie</em>, directed by Neill Blomkamp, which introduced me to the existence of artificial intelligence.
                <br><br>
                I went to Rutgers University and initially majored in pharmacy in hopes of a safe and secure job market. But I soon realized that I was meant to work in software and website development and decided to create a strong job market by improving myself. I switched from that field and decided not to settle for the easier route. I changed into a major in Information Technology with a minor in Computer Science, and I could not be happier. There are not many people today that say they love what they learn, but luckily, I find myself in my Data Structures class with a smile on my face every day! I aspire to continue to work on my programming skills, knowledge, and technique to write flawless and efficient code to create animated, useful, and very influential technologies!
